 * Get a reference on the specified set of credentials.  The caller must

 *
 * This is used to deal with a committed set of credentials.  Although the
 * pointer is const, this will temporarily discard the const and increment the
 * usage count.  The purpose of this is to attempt to catch at compile time the
 * accidental alteration of a set of credentials that should be considered
 * immutable.
